# React DOM Primitives

Base DOM Components used for swapping out DOM for React Native or other components via webpack

## Import functional DOM nodes
```js
import A from 'react-dom-primitives/A'
```

## Import class DOM nodes
```js
// class component for refs
import A from 'react-dom-primitives/A/A'
```

## Example

Alias `import Div from 'react-dom-primitives/Div` with `import { View } from "react-native";`

This would swap out `DOM` from `View`

## Todo

- [] Modernize with new bundler
